Description of the project: 
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover patterns and relationships between features that might predict passenger survival.
Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (imputed age with the median, filled Cabin with "Unknown", and Embarked with the most frequent value).

Removed duplicate rows and ensured the dataset was consistent and accurate.

Exploratory Data Analysis:Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between features (e.g., gender, class, age).

Created visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to identify trends and insights into passenger survival.

Data Transformation:Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaled numerical features for better model readiness.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Roles and Responsibilty:
1. Data Cleaning: Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data accuracy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored data relationships and identified key patterns influencing survival.

3.Feature Engineering: Transformed data by encoding categories and scaling numerical features.
4. Visualization and Reporting: Presented insights using visualizations to summarize findings.
